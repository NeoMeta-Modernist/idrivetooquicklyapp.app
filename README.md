This is an app that makes use of the corporate pinging that secret police are tracking our every move with-- and calculates the amount of time you've saved based on your rate of travel while driving by arithmetically  solving an equation.  The posted speed limit is a variable. To state it narrowly, the whole point is to validate safe, efficient driving by adept drivers with a sense of urgency, while acting as a platform for rightfully disgruntled human beings to plan for the future-- out of sight and out of earshot of all the obstructionists & fuddy-duddies with their plantation-owner mentalities.
